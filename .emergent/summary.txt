<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack application development from a detailed product statement, translating requirements into concrete technical designs and implementation plans. The process began with setting up the environment, then moved to backend API development (FastAPI, MongoDB for Numbers, Places, and Usage), followed by extensive frontend work (React, Tailwind CSS, PWA manifest). Key design considerations included UUIDs for MongoDB,  data for image uploads, and adhering to strict URL/environment variable rules. The engineer incrementally built UI components like navigation, search, detailed views for numbers and places, and implemented complex interactions such as long-press context menus and real-time phone number formatting. The most recent work focused on integrating promo codes/links into place details, including a visual badge and a dedicated dialog, all while refining UI/UX elements like button styles and layout. Error handling and UI state management were also addressed.

<product_requirements>
The application, named FIRST (com.ikkosss.first), is designed to track phone number usage at various locations (stores, pharmacies, websites) to facilitate new user bonuses.
Key features include:
1.  **Main Screen:** A vertically centered search field for phone numbers or place names, displaying suggestions as typed. If no match, it prompts to add the number or place.
2.  **Bottom Navigation:** A persistent three-button menu (SEARCH, NUMBERS, PLACES) with a distinct active state (blue background, white text).
3.  **Numbers Screen:** Lists added phone numbers with operator logos. A floating + button opens a dialog to add a number (with operator dropdown). Long-pressing a number opens a context menu (Edit/Delete/Cancel). Tapping a number opens its detail page.
4.  **Number Detail Page:** Displays the phone number and operator logo. Two horizontal buttons, Доступен (light green) and Использован (light red), toggle lists of places where the number is unused or used, respectively. These lists contain items with a toggle switch to change usage status.
5.  **Places Screen:** Displays a 3-column grid of place logos with names. A floating + button opens a dialog to add a place (name, category, logo upload). Long-pressing a place opens a context menu (Edit/Delete/Cancel). Sorting (New/Old/Popular) and category filters are at the top. Tapping a place logo opens its detail page.
6.  **Place Detail Page:** Displays place name and logo. Two horizontal buttons, Доступен (light green) and Использован (light red), toggle lists of numbers unused or used at that place, respectively. These lists contain items with a toggle switch to change usage status. Доступен is active by default.
7.  **Operators & Categories:** Predefined lists for phone operators (with logos) and place categories.
8.  **General Requirements:** Light theme, persistent data storage (MongoDB), instant UI updates, Material 3 design, PWA for Android installation, sharp corners for all UI elements.
9.  **Phone Number Formatting:** All phone number inputs must be immediately converted to  format.
10. **Promocode/Link Integration:** For places with a promo code or link, a circular badge (like notification count) appears on the top-right of the place logo on the Places screen. Clicking this badge opens a dialog to view/copy the promo code or open the link.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate  and  directories.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance:** Main FastAPI application. Defines MongoDB connection, data models, and all API endpoints.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Implemented ,  (with ,  fields),  using Pydantic and UUIDs.
        -   Created CRUD APIs for numbers and places (, ).
        -   Implemented file upload for place logos using  and Base64 storage.
        -   Added  endpoint to track number-place usage status.
        -   Implemented  for combined search of numbers and places.
        -   Added sorting for places by  (based on usage count).
        -   Integrated phone number normalization and validation functions (, ) for consistency and duplicate checking.
        -   Returns  and  flags in place data.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance:** Main React application component. Contains all page components, routing logic, state management, API calls, and UI interactions.

<pending_tasks>
-   **APK Generation:** The user asked about generating an APK, and the AI engineer proposed TWA or Capacitor options, but no choice was made, so this is pending.
-   **Fine-tuning UX:** Several minor UX adjustments were offered by the AI (e.g., hover effects, specific Material 3 color codes, haptic feedback on long-press) but not acted upon.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating promo code and link functionality into the Places section. This involved:

1.  **Backend Updates ():**
    *    was extended to include  (string) and  (string) fields.
    *   API endpoints for creating and updating places (, ) were modified to accept these new fields as  parameters.
    *    and  now return a  boolean flag if either  or  is present.

2.  **Frontend Updates ():**
    *   The  image (provided by the user) was integrated and is now available in .
    *   The Add/Edit Place dialog was updated to include input fields for ПРОМОКОД and ССЫЛКА НА РЕСУРС after the category selection.
    *   On the Places screen, if a place has a promo (indicated by ), a circular **promo badge** is displayed in the **top-right corner of the place's logo**. This badge is styled with sharp corners using  and a red background ().
    *   **Clicking the promo badge** opens a modal dialog that displays the promo code (if present) with a Копировать (Copy) button, and the resource link (if present) with a clickable link.
    *   **Clicking the place's logo** (not the badge) navigates to the detailed Place Details page.
    *   The place's name is now **not clickable** (it was previously, and clicked to open the promo dialog, but this was changed to the badge).

The last user message (Chat Message 188) was a re-iteration of the promo badge requirement: в случае, если при добавлении МЕСТА был добавлен промокод или ссылка - в правом верхнем углу логотипа места должен быть кружок, выглядищий так, как на иконках приложений обычно отображается количество новых уведомлений приложения. The AI engineer confirmed this implementation in Chat Message 187, stating it was Готово.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the implemented promo badge functionality and associated dialog on the МЕСТА screen, as described in the previous message.
