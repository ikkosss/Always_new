The trajectory outlines a comprehensive development and debugging cycle for a PWA named ПромоФон+. The initial focus was on fixing a critical bug where operator deletion was non-functional and relied on a native browser confirmation dialog. The AI engineer successfully implemented a backend  endpoint in  and integrated it into the  frontend, replacing the native dialog with a custom, styled modal. After the user confirmed this fix, the scope expanded to new feature requests. The user requested that all modals be limited to 70% of the viewport height with scrolling for overflow, and that check all / uncheck all functionality be added to the operator filter modal on the All Numbers page. The AI successfully implemented these features, making significant changes to  and .

Throughout the process, the AI also performed minor backend refactoring, addressing linter errors. The development was highly iterative, with the AI reporting progress and the user providing immediate feedback and new tasks. The trajectory concludes with the user reporting a new, critical bug: category deletion is not working, mirroring the initial problem that was fixed for operators. This indicates the next immediate task is to debug this new issue.

<product_requirements>
The application, ПромоФон+, is a Progressive Web App (PWA) for managing Operators and Categories. The primary user interaction is through a settings panel that provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for these two entities.

**Core Features & Requirements:**
- **Entity Management:** Users must be able to create, view, update, and delete Operators (with names and logos) and Categories (with names and icons).
- **Modal UI/UX:**
    - All modal windows must not exceed 70% of the screen's height. Content overflowing this limit must be scrollable.
    - Modals must close when the user clicks on the outside overlay.
    - The main settings modal must reset to its initial state upon reopening.
- **Button Consistency:** Action buttons (e.g., Save, Delete, Close) must be styled consistently (blue for save, red for delete) and have the same height as the main НАЙТИ (Search) button.
- **Filtering:** On the All Numbers page, the operator filter modal must include buttons to select all or deselect all operators at once, with the list filtering immediately.
- **Data Integrity:** All changes made in the settings must be reflected application-wide.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Monolith:** A React frontend contained primarily in  and a Python FastAPI backend in .
- **Database:** MongoDB is used for data persistence, with FastAPI handling the connection.
- **API Design:** RESTful API with CRUD endpoints for  and . File uploads are handled using .
- **Frontend State Management:** Component state is managed entirely within  using React Hooks (, ).
- **PWA Configuration:** The application is configured as a PWA via .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a simple monolithic structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend.



- ****
  - **Importance:** This file contains the entire backend logic, including the FastAPI application, API routes, and database interaction models for both Operators and Categories.
  - **Changes Summary:** Full CRUD endpoints for  and  were implemented. The code was refactored to resolve a function redefinition error ().

- ****
  - **Importance:** This single file contains the entire React application, including all components, state management, and API calls. It is the central point for all frontend logic.
  - **Changes Summary:** This file was heavily modified. Key changes include:
    - Implementing a custom confirmation modal to replace  for operator deletion.
    - Adding logic for the check/uncheck all functionality in the operator filter modal ( state).
    - Integrating the  API call and ensuring the UI state updates correctly upon successful deletion.
    - The logic for handling the creation and editing of both operators and categories is also present here.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This file contains all the custom styling for the application.
  - **Changes Summary:** Styles were added to enforce  and  on modal components to meet the new user requirement. Styles for action buttons () were also refined.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Category Deletion:** The user has reported that deleting categories does not work. This is the highest priority task.
- **UI Polishing (All Numbers Page):** Adjust paddings and the position of the three-dot menu for better alignment and symmetry.
- **Synchronize Operator Filters:** Ensure the operator selection/filter state is consistent across all modals where it appears (e.g., on the All Places page).
- **Improve Category Icon Uploads:** Polish the UI/UX for the category icon upload process.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer had just successfully completed two new feature requests from the user.
1.  **Modal Height and Scrolling:** All modals in the application were updated to have a  of , with  to enable scrolling for content that exceeds this height. This was implemented via changes in .
2.  **Operator Filter Bulk Selection:** In the Operators filter modal on the All Numbers page, two buttons were added to allow the user to check all or uncheck all operators at once. This involved significant state management changes in  related to the  state object.

Immediately after the engineer reported these tasks as complete, the user responded with a new bug report.

**The current and most immediate task is to address this new bug:** When a user tries to delete a category from the settings menu (), the action fails silently, and the category is not removed. This is now the active focus of the work.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the non-functional category deletion feature. This will involve analyzing the frontend code in  that triggers the deletion and verifying the corresponding  endpoint in .
