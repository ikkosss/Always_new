The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the FIRST application through a series of iterative design and feature enhancements. Initial work involved adding promo code functionality to place details, which was then extended. The engineer implemented dynamic dialogs for adding numbers/places based on search results, a backend endpoint for deleting places, and a robust toggle confirmation system for usage status. Significant UI/UX improvements included button styling, rounded place logos, enhanced typography, and refined separator lines. The search page underwent a complete overhaul, achieving precise positioning, sizing (50vw image, 100% search field), and a fixed, non-scrolling layout. Throughout, the engineer handled user queries regarding APK generation (directing to Mobile Agent) and generated a comprehensive application prompt. The process demonstrated strong problem-solving, debugging skills, and adherence to detailed user feedback, delivering a feature-rich and polished PWA.

The FIRST application tracks phone number usage at locations for new user bonuses. Key features include a search screen for numbers/places (now with a НАЙТИ button and auto-dialog for non-matches), persistent bottom navigation, and dedicated screens for Numbers and Places. Number/Place detail pages display specific data, toggle usage status, and now feature edit (pencil icon) and delete (trash bin icon) functionality with confirmation dialogues. Place entries support promo codes/links (with badges and view dialogues), comments, and logo uploads, with categories including CashBack and Прочее. UI is Material 3 with sharp corners (except rounded logos), phone numbers are auto-formatted, and the app functions as a PWA. Recent enhancements refined the search page layout (fixed, non-scrolling, 50vw image, 100% search field without padding), improved visibility of separator lines, ensured consistent button spacing, and made bottom navigation more prominent.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed a series of intricate UI/UX refinements on the FIRST application. The most recent set of tasks involved:

1.  **Search Page Layout:** The search page () was made non-scrollable (), with its content precisely centered. The  image, positioned above the search field, was set to a width of  (50% of the screen width), while the search input field was stretched to  screen width with  to reach from edge to edge. The spacing between the image and the search field was also halved to make the composition more compact.

2.  **Bottom Navigation Visibility:** The bottom navigation buttons were made more visible by applying a stronger box shadow () and a top border (), along with a subtle hover effect () for non-active buttons.

These changes were thoroughly tested with screenshots and confirmed to meet the user's explicit requirements for precision in positioning, sizing, and visual prominence.
