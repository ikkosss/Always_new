# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## user_problem_statement: Add НАЙТИ button in search field and auto-open dialogs for adding numbers/places when no search results found. If user types digits, open number dialog. If user types letters, open place dialog. Should work both on НАЙТИ button click and Enter key press.

Console shows 'Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener invocation' error. The React Portal menu with z-index 2147483647 is not rendering or becoming visible. This indicates a JavaScript/React state management issue where the nbMenuOpen state is not being properly set to true when the button is clicked. All UI elements are present but the click handler is not functioning correctly."

CRITICAL ISSUE PERSISTS: Menu still does not appear after clicking. Tested multiple click methods (force click, JavaScript click, event dispatch) - none work. No console errors detected. The openNbMenu function is not properly setting nbMenuOpen state to true. React Portal with menu items ('Редактировать', 'Удалить') is not rendering. This is a persistent React state management bug that requires main agent investigation into the openNbMenu function and nbMenuOpen state handling."

CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: Menu now appears correctly after clicking with 'Редактировать' and 'Удалить' buttons visible and functional. Clicking 'Редактировать' successfully opens the 'Редактировать номер' dialog with all required elements (phone input, operator select, save/cancel buttons). No console errors detected. The Portal repositioning closer to the header in JSX structure has fixed the React state management issue. Complete test flow successful: ⋮ click → menu appears → edit click → dialog opens."
